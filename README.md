# Dakwerken DS - my first assignment

## Overview

Recently I had been contacted by a friend who once made a website for a friend of his. It's basically a simple splashpage for a small construction business, showing the logo, some of the earlier works and ways to contact the person.

The page seemed to be dating back to years ago. Everything was setup strict and positioned absolutely: a nightmare in today's day and age.

The client wished his page was better viewable on his phone and on client's phones.

So I guess I just landed my first 'real' assignment! ðŸ˜‰

I just wanted to originally implement some smart CSS. But after analyzing the original page, it was clear that the entire HTML needed refactoring, because it was just so outdated, it wouldn't play nice with anything I was trying to do. On top of that, I wanted the page to be as clean and semantic as possible, so it was necessary.

The CSS was very outdated too. I tried to save what I can but I just got rid of as much lines of codes as I could. There was a lot of repetition. And most of the things defined in the original CSS we wouldn't need anymore anyway, when switching to flex.

So that is what I ended up doing.
* I switched the entire page to a flexbox model
* I reformed all the HTML making it more semantic
* Also kept accessibility into the back of my head, with focus styles and such.


I wanted to do more good on the SEO front. But I don't know too much about it yet and from what I've gathered, the focus these days is no longer keywords, but content, links, and so on.
Since the client has not really delivered any text content, I've left it for what it is for now, communicating to the client that they might want to add some actual content to the site.

But that's it! My first successful assignment and conversion of a classic site to a responsive model.
